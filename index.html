  <p>
I started out in Tri-Cities, WA where my passion for art and design grew with each passing day. Sports passified me throughout high school but once I reached college I decided it was time to pursue my true calling as a graphic designer.
</p>
<p>
I'm currently attending Eastern Washington University to receive a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Visual Communication Design. A public example of my design work can be seen on a signal box in downtown Spokane.
</p>
<p>
Her passions include drawing, painting, designing, spending time with her family, drinking unhealthy amounts of coffee in one sitting and long walks on the beach.
